# Classification Practice with Iris Data Set
This project was done to practice some basic classification concepts and was pushed to GitHub to satisfy requirements for Udacity's GitHub
review project.

This project was based on a step by step tutorial found on [machinelearningmastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/) and Udacity's finding donors project.

## List of sklearn algorithms used
* LogisticRegression
* AdaBoostClassifier
* GaussianProcessClassifier
* MLPClassifier

## Additional Notes
I may return to this project/dataset to practice with other machine learning algorithms or possibly practice writing an algorithm from scratch.
